abstract: The number of objectives in real-world problems has increased in recent
  years and better algorithms are needed to deal efficiently with it. One possible
  improvement to such algorithms is the use of adaptive operator selection mechanisms
  in many-objective optimization algorithms. In this work, two adaptive operator selection
  mechanisms, Probability Matching (PM) and Adaptive Pursuit (AP), are incorporated
  into the NSGA-III framework to autonomously select the most suitable operator while
  solving a many-objective problem. Our proposed approaches, NSGA-III$$_backslashtext
  AP$$and NSGA-III$$_backslashtext PM$$, are tested on benchmark instances from the
  DTLZ and WFG test suits and on instances of the Protein Structure Prediction Problem.
  Statistical tests are performed to infer the significance of the results. The preliminary
  results of the proposed approaches are encouraging.
