abstract: This paper proposes ELMOEA/D, a surrogate-assisted MOEA, for solving costly
  multi-objective problems in small evaluation budgets. The proposed approach encompasses
  a state-of-the-art MOEA based on decomposition and Differential Evolution (MOEA/D-DE)
  assisted by Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs). ELMOEA/D is tested in instances from
  three well-known benchmarks (ZDT, DTLZ and WFG) with 5?60 decision variables, 2
  and 5 objectives. The ELMOEA/D?s performance is also analyzed on a real problem
  (Airfoil Shape Optimization). The impact of some ELMs parameters and an automatic
  model selection mechanism is investigated. The results obtained by ELMOEA/D are
  compared with those of two state-of-the-art surrogate approaches (MOEA/D-RBF and
  ParEGO) and a non-surrogate-based MOEA (MOEA/D). The ELMOEA/D variants are among
  the best results for most benchmark instances and for the real problem.
