abstract: This paper investigates the efficiency of Harmony Search based algorithms
  for solving multi-objetive problems. For this task, four variants of the Harmony
  Search algorithm were adapted in the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II
  (NSGA-II) framework. Harmony Search is a recent proposed music-inspired metaheuristic
  while NSGA-II is a very successful evolutionary multi-objective algorithm. The four
  proposed methods are tested against each other using a set of benchmark instances
  proposed in CEC 2009. The best proposed algorithm is also compared with NSGA-II.
  The preliminary results are very promising and stand the proposed approach as a
  candidate to the State-of-the-art for multi-objective optimization, encouraging
  further researches in the hybridization of the Harmony Search and Multi-objective
  Evolutionary Algorithms.
