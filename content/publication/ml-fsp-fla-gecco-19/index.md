abstract: 'In the context of recommendation methods, meta-learning considers the use
  of previous knowledge regarding problems solution and performance to indicate the
  best strategy, whenever it faces a new similar problem. This paper studies the use
  of meta-learning to recommend local search strategies to solve several instances
  of permutation flowshop problems. The method proposed to conceive the meta-learning
  model is described considering three main phases: (i) extracting the problem features,
  (ii) building the performance database and (iii) training the recommendation model.
  In this work, we extract instances features mainly through fitness landscape analysis;
  build the performance data using the Irace parameter tuning algorithm and train
  neural networks models for recommendation. The paper also analyzes two mechanisms
  that support the recommendation: one using classification as its basis and another
  considering ranking processes. Experiments conducted on a wide range of different
  flowshop instances show that it is possible to recommend not only the best algorithms,
  but also some of their suitable configurations.'
