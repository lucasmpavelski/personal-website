 abstract = {In the context of recommendation methods, meta-learning considers the use of previous knowledge regarding problems solution and performance to indicate the best strategy, whenever it faces a new similar problem. This paper studies the use of meta-learning to recommend local search strategies to solve several instances of permutation flowshop problems. The method proposed to conceive the meta-learning model is described considering three main phases: (i) extracting the problem features, (ii) building the performance database and (iii) training the recommendation model. In this work, we extract instances features mainly through fitness landscape analysis; build the performance data using the Irace parameter tuning algorithm and train neural networks models for recommendation. The paper also analyzes two mechanisms that support the recommendation: one using classification as its basis and another considering ranking processes. Experiments conducted on a wide range of different flowshop instances show that it is possible to recommend not only the best algorithms, but also some of their suitable configurations.},
