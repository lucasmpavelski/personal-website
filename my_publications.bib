    abstract = "This paper analyses different multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to deal with the Environmental/Economic Load Dispatch (EELD). EELD is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem in which two competing objectives (fuel cost and pollutants emission) should be optimized simultaneously while fulfilling constraints. Due to the typical process of an evolutionary algorithm (EA), the use of operators applied to individuals of the population might violate constraint rules of the problem. The way in which EAs deal with such constraint rules is an important point and it is directly related to the quality of the generated solutions. One of the contributions of this paper is the analysis of the impact of a repair procedure in four multi-objective EAs. The analyzed approaches are evaluated in eight known instances (with 3, 6, 10, 20 and 40 generators) of the multi-objective EELD. Furthermore, two new instances (with 80 and 120 generators) are proposed and evaluated in this work. Experiments were applied using Dominance Ranking, hypervolume and unary-epsilon indicators, empirical attainment functions and statistical tests, in order to evaluate the algorithms performances. The results point to the consistency of the NSGA-II with repair procedure compared to the literature algorithms, and it outperforms other approaches in most of the considered instances."

    abstract={This work proposes a meta-learning system based on Gradient Boosting Machines to recommend local search heuristics for solving flowshop problems. The investigated approach can decide if a metaheuristic (MH) is suitable for each instance. It can also provide well-suited parameters for each recommended MH using data from Irace parameter tuning. This paper considers four MHs (Hill Climbing, Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, and Iterated Local Search) as candidates to solve several flowshop instances. In the experiments, 540 flowshop problems (with different sizes, variants, and objectives) and 50 instances for each problem are considered, resulting in a total of 27,000 instances being addressed. We use simple low-level meta-features in the meta-learning system like the number of jobs and machines, processing time distribution, flowshop variant, objective, and evaluations budget. Besides testing the recommendations in terms of accuracy and Kappa (for MH and categorical parameters), RMSE and R2 (for numerical parameters), we also explore the importance of each meta-feature in MH recommendation models. Moreover, we perform a multiple correspondence analysis on MH configurations to gain further insights into the parameters values. Results show that the proposed approach is promising, particularly for MH recommendation.},

    abstract={This work investigates the use of meta-learning for optimization tasks when a classic operational research problem (flowshop) is considered at the base level. It involves sequencing a set of jobs to be processed by machines in series aiming to minimize the time spent. There are various algorithms or metaheuristics proposed to solve flowshop instances and the choice of the best one usually demands time and resources. Meta-learning applied to algorithm recommendation can simulate specialists' choices as it provides a mapping between the problem characteristics (called meta-features) and the algorithm performance. This work proposes an approach for knowledge discovery operating on the performance of four metaheuristics (Hill Climbing, Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, and Iterated Local Search) while solving several flowshop instances. Besides recommending the best metaheuristic for each instance, the proposed approach can also recommend well suited parameters values using an Irace-based training process. Despite the possibility of using complex meta-features and powerful machine learning technique, the first experiments have been conducted using simple low and high-level meta-features and a classic machine learning model called Classification and Regression Trees (CART) for the recommendation. Results show that the proposed approach is promising as the induced rules indicate that some metaheuristic parameters are preferable. Nevertheless, regarding the algorithm recommendation there is a lot of room for improvement.},

  abstract={Many real optimization problems have more than one objective function. When the objectives are in conflict, there is a need for specialized strategies, as is the case of the Multi-objective Optimization Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). However, if the functions evaluation is expensive (high computational or economical costs) many proposed MOEAs are impractical. An alternative might be the use of a machine learning model to approximate the fitness function (surrogates) in the optimization algorithm. This work proposes and investigates a framework called ELMOEA/D that aggregates state-of-the-art MOEAs based on decomposition of objectives (MOEA/D) and extreme learning machines as surrogate models. The proposed framework is tested with different MOEA/D variants and show good results in benchmark problems, compared to a literature algorithm that also encompasses MOEA/D but uses surrogate models based on radial basis function networks. The ELMOEA/D framework is also applied to the protein structure prediction problem (PSPP). Despite the fact that the results achieved by the proposed approach were not as encouraging as the ones achieved in the benchmarks (when the algorithms with and without surrogates are compared), many aspects of both algorithm and problem are explored. Finally, the ELMOEA/D framework is applied to an alternative formulation of the PSPP and the results lead to various directions for future works.}

    abstract={Despite the success of Evolutionary Algorithms in solving complex problems, they may require many function evaluations. This becomes an issue when dealing with costly problems. Surrogate models may overcome this difficulty, though their use in problems with medium to large dimensionality is underexplored in the literature. Problems with multiple conflicting objectives can be formulated as Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs). MOPs have received a great attention lately, mainly with Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). This paper proposes ELMOEA/D-DE, a surrogate-assisted MOEA, for solving expensive MOPs in small evaluation budgets. ELMOEA/D-DE encompasses a state-of-the-art MOEA based on decomposition, Differential Evolution (DE) operators and Extreme Learning Machines. This paper tests three variants of ELMOEA/D-DE, using different DE operators, for solving five known benchmark MOPs with 10 to 60 decision variables. All variants achieve good results in terms of hyper volume metric and the best variant with operator DE/rand/1/bin is compared with two state-of-the-art approaches (MOEA/D-RBF and a non-surrogate-based MOEA), achieving the best results in all but one problems instances.},
